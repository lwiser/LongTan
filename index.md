### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
#### Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China)
Graph500 BFS Algorithm Optimization (Mar 2019 - Present)
* Optimized BFS algorithm based on Kronecker graph to increase the traversal edges per second(TEPS)
* Achieved 50 GTEPS on graph with scale 28, utilizing 4-way Xeon 8160 Server
* Proposed two main approches for single-node cpu(numa architecture)
  * round-robin vertex shuffle to improve **load balancing among threads and numa nodes (1.5 times speed up)**
  * bitmap jump-access to **avoid unnecessary accessing** of bitmap in the bottom-up step
* Devised a 1D data decomposition approach for distributed BFS algorithm and compressed integar using varint to reduce
communication overhead among cluster nodes

#### Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China)
Superconducting Cpu Simulator (Aug 2018 - May 2019  )
* Developed a simulator for the special architecture of SuperConducting Cpu using RISCV-32I instruction set
* Realized simulator’s speed to 1 million instructions per second
* Designed a method to simulate **Wave-Pipeline**, which was divided into five stages logically, and whether an instruction
entered the next stage was determined by comparing **next_stage_cycle** with **system_cycle** in the next stage
* Implemented the instruction set of RISCV spec in simulator, which could run ELF files generated by RISCV compiler
* Constructed 5 kinds of topolpgy with cache or spm to find a structure with higher IPC
#### University of Science and Technology Beijing (Beijing, China)
Smart Car Contest, Captain (Apr 2016 - Jul 2016)
* Aimed to make car trace as quickly as possible under **electromagnetic induction** controlling with Freescale’s car models
by optimizing circuits layout and algorithm
* Earned the second prize of Smart car Competition among 40 teams
* **Hardware**: Designed the circuit of car including power, motor, servo modules and built the car’s structure
* **Software**: Completed curve-detection algorithm on Kinetis chip, which detected curves or straights to adjust speed
precisely with 3 values generated by electromagnetic
