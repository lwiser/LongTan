### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
#### Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China)
Graph500 BFS Algorithm Optimization (Dec 2018 - Present)
* Optimized BFS algorithm based on Kronecker graph to increase the traversal edges per second(TEPS)
* Achieved 50 GTEPS on graph with scale 28, utilizing 4-way Xeon 8160 Server
* Proposed two main approches for single-node cpu(numa architecture)
  * round-robin vertex shuffle to improve **load balancing among threads and numa nodes (1.5 times speed up)**
  * bitmap jump-access to **avoid unnecessary accessing** of bitmap in the bottom-up step
* Devised a 1D data decomposition approach for distributed BFS algorithm and compressed integar using varint to reduce
communication overhead among cluster nodes

#### Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China)
Superconducting Cpu Simulator (May 2018 - May 2019  )
* Developed a simulator for the special architecture of SuperConducting Cpu using RISCV-32I instruction set
* Designed a method called **delay synchronization to simulate Wave-Pipeline**, which was divided into **five stages
logically**, consisting of fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back
* Implemented the instruction set of RISCV spec in simulator, which can run ELF files generated by RISCV compiler

#### University of Science and Technology Beijing (Beijing, China)
Smart Car Contest, Captain (April 2016 - Jul 2016)
* Accomplished circuits layout and optimized algorithm to make car trace as quickly as possible under electromagnetic
induction controlling based on Freescale’s car models
* Earned the second prize of Smart car Competition
* **Hardware**: Designed the circuit of car including power, motor, servo modules and constructed the car’s structure
* **Software**: Completed program, which detected curves or staights to adjust speed sensitively and precisely based on
Kinetis chip
